Final Vision Statement:

How often have you been down to the laundry room only to find out all the machines are being used? Or, how many times have you gone down to the laundry room just to see your laundry on top of a dirty machine? This is exactly why our Tidey Team decided to develop the app, Calvin Klean, that prevents these situations from occurring. As such, our primary target customers are Calvin University students who use community laundry services. The Calvin Klean app is a Laundry Cycle Tracking app that will help you be more efficient and practical in doing your mundane everyday chores. Unlike the timer app where users have to manually track the time for their laundry, our Calvin Klean app will keep track of available machines and automatically detect the remaining time of the machines being used. With Calvin Klean, you'll never have to waste time or deal with laundry frustrations again, as the app ensures a smoother, more efficient laundry experience for all Calvin University students.
