# Revolutionizing Laundry for Calvin Students: The Calvin Klean Promise

How often have you gone to do laundry only to find all the machines taken? Or worse, finding your clean clothes tossed aside? These annoying moments are exactly what Calvin Klean is here to fix. Our app is designed for Calvin University students who use shared laundry rooms and need an easier way to manage their laundry.

Unlike basic timer apps where you track your laundry manually, Calvin Klean does more. It tracks machine availability and monitors the remaining cycle time of machines in use. With real-time notifications, youâ€™ll know the moment your laundry or dryer is done. No more wasted trips or worrying about your clothes being mishandled. Calvin Klean makes laundry easier and stress-free for all Calvin students.
