Revolutionizing Laundry for Calvin Students: The Calvin Klean Promise

How often have you found yourself heading down to the laundry room, only to realize all the machines are in use? Or worse, discovering your freshly washed clothes tossed aside on a dirty machine? These frustrating moments are exactly what the Calvin Klean app aims to eliminate. Our primary customers are Calvin University students who rely on shared laundry services and need a smoother, more efficient way to manage their laundry routines.

Unlike traditional timer apps where users have to manually track their laundry time, Calvin Klean goes a step further. It not only tracks the availability of machines but also automatically monitors the remaining cycle time of machines in use. With real-time updates and alerts, Calvin Klean ensures that you never waste a trip to the laundry room or have your laundry mishandled again. Itâ€™s designed to streamline your laundry experience and have an efficient laundry experience for all Calvin University students.
