How often have you gone to do laundry only to find all the machines taken? Or worse, you find your clean clothes tossed aside? Calvin Klean eliminates these common frustrations for Calvin University students by providing a smarter way to manage shared laundry rooms.

Calvin Klean surpasses basic apps like LaundryView by tracking machine availability in real time and notifying students when washers and dryers open up. This feature helps you plan laundry trips efficiently and ensures your clothes remain secure.
