Usability Test Report: Calvin Klean
 Fall 2024
 Tidey Team
The usability testing for the Calvin Klean Laundry App aimed to evaluate the app's features, design, and overall user experience. Participants were asked to perform tasks such as navigating the homepage, checking machine availability, and testing the notification feature. The goal was to identify strengths and areas for improvement to enhance the app’s functionality for Calvin University students.
Overall, users reacted positively to the app’s design, describing the interface as simple, intuitive, and visually appealing. They highlighted the clarity of navigation and the efficiency of the machine availability feature, which they found helpful in tracking real-time statuses of washers and dryers. The icon-switching mechanism between washers and dryers and the information on the "About" page also stood out as appreciated features.
Despite the praise, some areas for improvement were identified. The notification feature was seen as unnecessarily complicated, with users finding the extra page after clicking “Get Notified” redundant. Additionally, while users appreciated the availability feature, they suggested adding a timer to track laundry progress directly in the app, eliminating the need for external timers. Another recommendation was to include text labels for the washer and dryer icons to improve accessibility and usability. The notification icon itself was not immediately intuitive to some users, prompting a call for redesign or improved placement. Finally, users questioned the need for the app’s start button in its current state, noting that without a login or dorm selection feature, it served little purpose and could be repurposed.
Moving forward, the development team will focus on simplifying the notification process by removing the extra page and redesigning the notification icon for better visibility. A timer feature will be explored to provide users with real-time progress updates for active machines. Text labels will be added to washer and dryer icons to enhance clarity, and the start button will be reconsidered or reimagined for future functionality. These updates will ensure that the app remains user-friendly and meets the needs of Calvin University students.
This usability test was instrumental in highlighting the app’s strengths and uncovering opportunities for improvement. The team is committed to addressing these suggestions in the next development phase to deliver an even more efficient and user-centric laundry app.
